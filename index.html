                    Hi! My name is Magnus. I am currently taking a <i>Masters in Information Systems</i>
                    at the University of Agder. I am looking forward at working in the tech industry
                    when I am finished with my degree.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the last few years I have spent more and more time programming, and now I code
                    every single day. I like the problem solving and I like to understand how programms and
                    applications work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My programming experience is a mix of projects from my study and personal projects, mostly from
                    the online coding platform <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>
                </p>

                <p class="project-description">
                    This <a href="https://github.com/erdvik/EgdeBookingSystemV2">project</a> was my final delivery for my bachelor's degree in information systems.
                    We were a group of six students that made a booking website for the consultant firm <a href="https://egde.no/">Egde</a>. We used Microsoft's ASP.NET framework
                    with the C# programming language.

                <p class="project-description">
                    In this <a href="https://github.com/erdvik/us-medical-insurance-costs">project</a> I investigated medical insurance costs data from the US to
                    answer some questions. I used Python and Jupyter Notebook. I like the datascience process and might pursue this field further.

                </summary>
                <p class="project-description">
                    In this simple Javascript <a href="https://github.com/erdvik/credit-card-checker">project</a> I made a script that checks the validity of some
                    mock credit card numbers. I think Javscript is an interesting language and it is used everywhere so its definetly good to have and unserstanding of.
